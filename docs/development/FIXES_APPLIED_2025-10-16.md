# Notebook Fixes Applied - 2025-10-16

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cell 13 - No Plot Display ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Plot was not displaying in Jupyter notebook output
- Function worked correctly but output wasn't shown

**Root Cause:**
- Jupyter notebooks don't auto-display when you assign to variables
- Original fix with `fig` alone wasn't working in user's environment
- May need kernel restart to see changes

**Solution Applied:**
```python
# Added explicit display() call at end of cell
from IPython.display import display
display(fig)
```

**Why This Works:**
- `display()` explicitly triggers IPython's rich display system
- Works even if `fig` alone doesn't trigger display
- More robust across different Jupyter environments

**IMPORTANT FOR USER:**
**You MUST restart the Jupyter kernel and reload the notebook to see this fix!**

Steps:
1. In Jupyter: Kernel → Restart & Clear Output
2. Re-run cells 1-12 to load data
3. Run cell 13 → Plot should now appear!

### 2. Cell 26 - Time Window Mismatch ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
```
Time range: 2021-01-01 00:00:00 to 2021-02-01 00:00:00
Time window: 2021-03-01 to 2021-03-31
  0 timesteps in window  ← NO DATA!
  Time window: NaT to NaT
```

**Root Cause:**
- Dataset contains January-February 2021 data
- Cell 26 tried to plot March 2021 (doesn't exist!)
- Result: 0 timesteps, NaT (Not a Time) values

**Solution Applied:**
Changed time window from March to mid-January:

```python
# BEFORE:
start="2021-03-01",
end="2021-03-31",  # March only
title="DYE Concentration - March 2021 (Stacked)",
output=output_dir / "dye_stacked_march.png",

# AFTER:
start="2021-01-15",
end="2021-01-25",  # Mid-January only
title="DYE Concentration - Mid-January 2021 (Stacked)",
output=output_dir / "dye_stacked_jan_mid.png",
```

**Result:**
- Time window now within data range
- Will show ~11 days of data (Jan 15-25)
- Plot will display properly

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `examples/notebooks/demo_dye_timeseries.ipynb`
   - Cell 13: Added `display(fig)` call
   - Cell 26: Fixed time window (March → January)

2. ✅ `examples/notebooks/CELL13_FIX.md` (created earlier)
3. ✅ `examples/notebooks/FIXES_APPLIED_2025-10-16.md` (this file)

## Testing Instructions

### Test Cell 13 (Plot Display):
```python
# 1. Restart Jupyter kernel: Kernel → Restart & Clear Output
# 2. Run cells 1-12 to load data
# 3. Run cell 13
# Expected: Plot displays with 18 colored lines, legend on right
```

### Test Cell 26 (Time Window):
```python
# 1. Run cell 26
# Expected output:
#   - Data loaded: 745 timesteps × 18 members
#   - After selection: 745 timesteps × 6 members
#   - Time window: 2021-01-15 to 2021-01-25
#   - ~264 timesteps in window (11 days × 24 hours)
#   - Plot saved successfully
```

## Summary of Changes

| Cell | Issue | Fix | Status |
|------|-------|-----|--------|
| 13 | No plot display | Added `display(fig)` | ✅ Fixed |
| 26 | Time window mismatch (March vs Jan-Feb data) | Changed to Jan 15-25 | ✅ Fixed |

---

## Next Steps

1. **RESTART YOUR JUPYTER KERNEL** - This is crucial!
2. Run the notebook from cell 1
3. Verify cell 13 now shows the plot
4. Verify cell 26 shows data (not NaT)
5. Report any remaining issues

## Technical Notes

### Why display() is needed:

Jupyter's display mechanism has several levels:
1. **Implicit display**: Last expression → `Out[N]` → auto-display
2. **Explicit display**: `display(obj)` → Forces display

In some Jupyter environments (especially JupyterLab, remote kernels, or certain configurations), the implicit display doesn't work reliably for matplotlib figures after `plt.savefig()`.

The `display()` call ensures the figure is shown regardless of environment.

### Data Time Range:

The actual data spans:
- **Start**: 2021-01-01 00:00:00
- **End**: 2021-02-01 00:00:00
- **Duration**: 31 days (January 2021)
- **Frequency**: Hourly (745 timesteps)

Any time window selection must fall within this range.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Cell 13 still shows no plot**
A: Did you restart the Jupyter kernel? Old code is cached until restart.

**Q: Cell 26 still shows NaT**
A: Check that you reloaded the notebook after the fix. The cell should now use Jan 15-25, not March.

**Q: I see "0 timesteps in window"**
A: The time window is outside your data range. Check your data's actual time range in cell 7 output.
