# Active nodes (1-based Fortran indices)
# These are the nodes where groundwater discharge occurs
active_nodes: [637, 638, 639, 662]

# Groundwater flux velocity (m/s) - NOT volumetric flux!
# Can be:
# 1. Single value (constant for all nodes and times)
flux: 1.0e-6

# 2. List of values (one per active node, constant in time)
# flux: [1.0e-6, 2.0e-6, 1.5e-6, 3.0e-6]

# 3. CSV file with time series (see format below)
# flux: "flux_timeseries.csv"

# Temperature (Â°C)
# Same options as flux:
# 1. Single value
temperature: 10.0

# 2. List (one per active node)
# temperature: [10.0, 12.0, 11.0, 9.5]

# 3. CSV file with time series
# temperature: "temperature_timeseries.csv"

# Salinity (PSU)
# Same options as flux:
# 1. Single value
salinity: 0.5

# 2. List (one per active node)
# salinity: [0.0, 0.5, 0.3, 1.0]

# 3. CSV file with time series
# salinity: "salinity_timeseries.csv"

# Optional: Dye concentration
# dye: 100.0
# dye: [100.0, 150.0, 120.0, 200.0]
# dye: "dye_timeseries.csv"

# Time zone for input data (output is always UTC)
# Default: "Asia/Tokyo" (following xfvcom convention)
timezone: "UTC"

# Notes:
# - All times in output NetCDF are in UTC
# - Input times in CSV files are interpreted in the specified timezone
# - Active nodes use 1-based (Fortran) indexing
